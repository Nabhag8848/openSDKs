In the future we will implement features like tRPC links for extensibility for all SDKs. tRPC links can
be found here: [https://trpc.io/docs/client/links](https://trpc.io/docs/client/links)
```ts

const discord = createSdk(discordSdkDef, {
  links: [
    rateLimitLink({storage: AsyncStorage}),
    retryLink(),
    authorizationLink({storage: AsyncStorage}),
    logLink({verbose: true}),
  ]
})
```
